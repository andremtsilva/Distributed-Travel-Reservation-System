# Think of a random number between 2000 and 5000, say, 2100, and change the value of RMIREGPORT in first line of Makefile from 1099 to this number. This is the port number where your rmiresgistry will be listening. Giving it a random number will ensure that your rmiresgistry doesn't conflict with somebody else's.
